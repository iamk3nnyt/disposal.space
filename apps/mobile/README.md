        "EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL": "https://untitled-monorepo-untitled.vercel.app"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Code Style

This project uses:

- TypeScript for type safety

### Demo Account for Reviewers

Since the app uses Clerk authentication, provide test credentials:

Email: reviewer@disposalspace.com
Password: [Create a simple test password]
Instructions: Use provided credentials to test the app functionality
```

### Common Review Issues to Avoid

- **Missing Privacy Policy**: Required if collecting user data
- **Broken Authentication**: Ensure Clerk login works in production
- **Missing Content**: App must have actual functionality beyond login
- **Crashes**: Test thoroughly in TestFlight first
- **Misleading Description**: Description must match actual functionality
- **Missing Screenshots**: All required device sizes must be provided
- **Demo Account Issues**: Ensure test credentials work properly

### Post-Submission Monitoring

#### Track Review Status

1. **App Store Connect Dashboard**
   - Monitor review status changes
   - Check for reviewer feedback
   - Respond to any questions promptly

2. **Email Notifications**
   - Apple sends status updates via email
   - Check spam folder if not receiving notifications
   - Notifications include: In Review, Approved, Rejected

#### If Rejected

1. **Read Feedback Carefully**
   - Apple provides specific reasons for rejection
   - Address each point mentioned in the feedback

2. **Fix Issues**
   - Update code if necessary
   - Rebuild and resubmit if code changes needed
   - Update metadata if only listing issues

3. **Resubmit**

   ```bash
   # If code changes needed
   eas build --platform ios --profile production --auto-submit

   # If only metadata changes needed
   # Update in App Store Connect and resubmit
   ```

#### After Approval

1. **App Goes Live**
   - App appears on App Store immediately after approval
   - Users can download and install

2. **Monitor Performance**
   - Check App Store Connect Analytics
   - Monitor crash reports and user feedback
   - Respond to user reviews

3. **Plan Updates**
   - Gather user feedback
   - Plan feature improvements
   - Prepare next version updates

### Environment Configuration

The app uses the following environment variables:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Clerk authentication key
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Backend API endpoint

**Important Notes:**

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variables are publicly visible in the app bundle
- Environment variables are baked into the build and require rebuilding when changed
- Use production Clerk keys for App Store releases

### Updating Production App

To push updates after initial submission:

1. Update version in `app.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "expo": {
       "version": "1.0.1"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Build and submit update:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile production --auto-submit
   ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Build Failures**: Check environment variables and certificates
- **Submission Issues**: Verify App Store Connect App ID
- **Authentication Problems**: Ensure Clerk keys are correct
